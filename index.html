      <h3>Barad-d没r LEGO Set</h3>
      <p><strong>Published:</strong> October 13, 2024</p>
      <p><strong>Author:</strong> Aidan Marentette</p>
      <p style="font-size: 11px;">The Barad-d没r set is a highly anticipated LEGO set that brings the iconic tower from the Lord of the Rings universe to life. This detailed set includes screen accurate architecture and is a must for any fan of the series. Standing tall, the set showcases the dark and foreboding essence of Sauron's stronghold, perfect for display or imaginative play. This set is on this list because I am personally a Lord of the Rings fan and have watched the movies growing up. In order to purchase this set, you must have $450 laying around. That's pretty expensive, but this set would make a great display for anyone that is a fan of legos and LOTR. This set is ranked #1 on my wishlist and if I ever decide to purchase a lego set, this would be the one. Not only does this set have great architecture within its build, it also has great minifigures, such as Sauron and the mouth of Sauron in lego form. If I were to rate this set out of 10 points, I would give it 11 points just because of how massive it truly is. I could possibly see myself buying this set in the near future once I get my money up.</p>

        <h3>Jabba's Sail Barge LEGO Set</h3>
        <p><strong>Published:</strong> October 13, 2024</p>
        <p><strong>Author:</strong> Aidan Marentette</p>
        <p style="font-size: 11px;">Jabba's Sail Barge is another iconic LEGO set from the Star Wars universe. It recreates the famous scene from "Return of the Jedi," where Luke Skywalker faces off against Jabba the Hutt. The set includes intricate details of the sail barge, along with multiple minifigures like Jabba, Leia, and R2-D2. It's perfect for collectors and Star Wars fans who want to bring this legendary scene to life. This set caught my eye as soon is at came out. Being a huge StarWars fan, one of my favorite parts of Return of the Jedi was the epic sail barge scene. When I was younger, Lego released a similar Jabba's Sailbarge Lego set that made my mouth drool however, I did not have adult money like I do now in order to purchase it. Sadly, I never got the chance to buy one for myself, but now that the geniuses at Lego decided to reboot the idea, I may have to splooge and buy myself a sail barge. In order to purchase this set you are required to have $500 sitting around somewhere. That is ridiculus and Lego should really decrease the prices on some of their sets. Thank you for reading my blog.</p>
